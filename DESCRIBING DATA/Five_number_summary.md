## ðŸ“Š Five-Number Summary Includes:

# 1) Minimum: 
The smallest value in the data.

# 2) First Quartile (Q1): 
25% of data is below this value.

# 3) Median (Q2): 
The middle value that splits the data in half (50% below, 50% above).

# 4) Third Quartile (Q3): 
75% of data is below this value.

# 5) Maximum: 
The largest value in the data.


## Let's take a simple real dataset of fuel consumption (in liters per 100 km) for 10 trucks:

ðŸšš Fuel Consumption Data:
[18, 20, 22, 19, 25, 21, 28, 17, 23, 15]

ðŸ“Š Step-by-Step Calculation of the Five-Number Summary

Step 1: Sort the Data in Ascending Order:
[15, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 25, 28]

Step 2: Find the Minimum and Maximum:
Minimum: 15 (smallest value)
Maximum: 28 (largest value)

Step 3: Find the Median (Q2):
Since there are 10 numbers (even count), the median is the average of the 5th and 6th values.
5th value = 20, 6th value = 21
Median (Q2) = (20 + 21) / 2 = 20.5

Step 4: Find Q1 (First Quartile - 25th percentile):
Q1 is the median of the lower half of the data (left of the median):
[15, 17, 18, 19, 20]
Median of this part = 18 (3rd value)
Q1 = 18

Step 5: Find Q3 (Third Quartile - 75th percentile):
Q3 is the median of the upper half of the data (right of the median):
[21, 22, 23, 25, 28]
Median of this part = 23 (3rd value)
Q3 = 23

## âœ… Final Five-Number Summary:
Minimum: 15
Q1: 18
Median (Q2): 20.5
Q3: 23
Maximum: 28

## ðŸš€ What Each Number Tells You in Real Life:

ðŸ”½ Minimum (15 L/100 km):

This truck is the most fuel-efficient.
It uses the least fuel to travel 100 km.
Maybe itâ€™s a new model or drives mostly on smooth roads.

ðŸ“¦ First Quartile (Q1 = 18 L/100 km):

25% of trucks consume less than 18 L/100 km.
Represents trucks that are quite fuel-efficient.
Could be due to good driving habits or lighter loads.

âš¡ Median (20.5 L/100 km):

This is the middle truck in terms of fuel consumption.
Half of the trucks use less than this, and half use more.
Shows the typical fuel consumption for your fleet.

ðŸ“¦ Third Quartile (Q3 = 23 L/100 km):

75% of trucks consume less than 23 L/100 km.
Trucks above this are less fuel-efficient.
Could indicate older models or trucks driving on hilly routes.

ðŸ”¼ Maximum (28 L/100 km):

This truck is the least fuel-efficient.
It consumes the most fuel to travel 100 km.
Might be due to engine problems, heavy loads, or poor maintenance.
