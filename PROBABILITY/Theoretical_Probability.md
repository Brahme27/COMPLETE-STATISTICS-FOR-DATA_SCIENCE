# **Theoretical Probability: A Simple Guide**  

Probability measures how likely an event is to happen. There are two main types:  

### **1. Theoretical Probability**  
- Based on mathematical calculations, not real experiments.  
- Formula:  
  \[
  P(A) = \frac{\text{desired outcomes}}{\text{total possible outcomes}}
  \]  

ðŸ”¹ **Example:** Probability of rolling a **2** on a six-sided die:  
  \[
  P(2) = \frac{1}{6}
  \]  

### **2. Experimental Probability**  
- Based on actual results from experiments.  
- Formula:  
  \[
  P(A) = \frac{\text{times event occurs}}{\text{total trials}}
  \]  

ðŸ”¹ **Example:** If a die is rolled **11 times** and lands on **2 three times**:  
  \[
  P(2) = \frac{3}{11}
  \]  

### **Key Difference**  
- **Theoretical Probability**: Uses math to predict outcomes.  
- **Experimental Probability**: Uses real-world data from experiments.  

### **Why Use Theoretical Probability?**  
- Faster and easier than conducting experiments.  
- Useful for making predictions.  

ðŸ”¹ **Example:** A school knows that **1 in 30 students** needs math help. If there are **300 students**, they expect:  
  \[
  300 \times \frac{1}{30} = 10 \text{ students needing help}
  \]  

### **More Theoretical Probability Examples**  
âœ… **Picking a green ball from a bag of 9 balls (3 red, 4 green, 2 purple)**  
  \[
  P(\text{green}) = \frac{4}{9}
  \]  
âœ… **Rolling a 7 on a 9-sided die**  
  \[
  P(7) = \frac{1}{9}
  \]  
âœ… **Picking a girl's name from a bag (3 boys, 7 girls)**  
  \[
  P(\text{girl}) = \frac{7}{10}
  \]  

### **Conclusion**  
- **Theoretical probability** is based on **math**, while **experimental probability** is based on **actual data**.  
- It helps in making **quick predictions** without running real-world trials.
