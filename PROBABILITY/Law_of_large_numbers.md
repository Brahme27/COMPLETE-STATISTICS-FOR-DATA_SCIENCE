# **Law of Large Numbers (Simplified Guide)**  

## **1. Definition**  
The **Law of Large Numbers** states that as a **sample size increases**, the **sample mean** gets closer to the **expected value**.  

### **Example: Coin Flipping**  
- Probability of getting **heads** = **0.5 (50%)**.  
- If you flip **10 times**, you might get heads only **3 times** (30%).  
- But if you flip **10,000 times**, the proportion of heads will be much **closer to 50%**.  

 **Conclusion:** More trials = More accuracy in results!

## **2. Real-World Applications**  

### **(i) Casinos**  
- Casinos win **51-55%** of the time in most games.  
- Some players **win**, some **lose**, but over **thousands of games**, casinos **always profit** because of the **law of large numbers**.  

**Example:**  
- Jessica wins **$50**, Mike loses **$70**, John wins **$25**, Susan loses **$40**.  
- Over thousands of players, the **casino wins the expected percentage**.

### **(ii) Insurance**  
- Insurance companies **collect money from thousands of people** but **only a few will need payouts**.  
- The **larger the number of customers, the more predictable the profits**.  

**Example:**  
- **1,000 people** each pay **$1,000** → Insurance collects **$1,000,000**.  
- **90 people** need payouts of **$900,000**.  
- **Profit = $100,000**.  

 **If they only had 10 customers, a big payout could bankrupt them!**

### **(iii) Renewable Energy**  
- **Wind turbines & solar panels** are unreliable on their own.  
- But **connecting thousands** to a **single power grid** makes energy production **predictable**.  

**Example:**  
- Some turbines may **stop working**, but with **thousands connected**, engineers can **accurately estimate** total energy output.

## **3. Summary**  
✔ The **Law of Large Numbers** makes results **more predictable** as **sample size increases**.  
✔ **Casinos, insurance, and renewable energy companies** all rely on this principle.  
✔ **More data = More accurate predictions!**
