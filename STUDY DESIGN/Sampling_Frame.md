### **What is a Sampling Frame?**  

A **sampling frame** is the actual list of individuals from which a sample is drawn. Ideally, it should match the **target population** (the entire group researchers are interested in studying), but in reality, there are often differences.  

 **Example:**  
Suppose researchers want to study the **percentage of adults (18+) in a city who support a new law**.  

- **Target Population:** All residents over 18 years old in the city (e.g., 100,000 people).  
- **Sampling Frame:** The list of people they can actually contact (e.g., voter registration records, census data).  

Since some people **may have moved, turned 18 recently, or not be listed**, the **sampling frame does not perfectly match the target population**.

### **Sampling Frame vs. Target Population**  
| **Term** | **Definition** | **Example** |
|-----------|--------------|------------|
| **Target Population** | The complete group of individuals the researcher wants to study. | All adults (18+) in a city. |
| **Sampling Frame** | The actual list of individuals from which the sample is selected. | Voter registration records, census lists. |
| **Sample** | The subset of the population that is actually surveyed. | 1,000 randomly selected adults from the list. |

### **Sampling Frame Error**  
Since the **sampling frame may not include everyone in the target population**, it can lead to **sampling frame error**—where some groups are overrepresented or underrepresented.  

**Example of Sampling Frame Error:**  
- Using **phone directories** as a sampling frame may exclude people without landlines.  
- Using **voter registration records** may miss **non-registered** individuals.  

To **reduce error**, researchers try to use **the most complete and updated lists** available.

### **Key Takeaways**  
✔ The **sampling frame** is the actual list used to select a sample.  
✔ It should be as close as possible to the **target population**, but differences usually exist.  
✔ **Sampling frame errors** can lead to bias if certain groups are excluded.  
✔ A **well-chosen sampling frame improves the accuracy** of research findings.
