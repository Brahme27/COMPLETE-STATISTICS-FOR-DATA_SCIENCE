# **Explanatory & Response Variables: Simplified Guide**  

## **1. What are Explanatory and Response Variables?**  
- **Explanatory Variable**: Also called an **independent** or **predictor** variable, it explains variations in another variable.  
- **Response Variable**: Also called a **dependent** or **outcome** variable, it changes based on the explanatory variable.  

In experiments, researchers manipulate the **explanatory variable** to observe its effect on the **response variable**.

## **2. Examples**  

### **Example 1: Plant Growth**  
A botanist tests **two fertilizers** on plants for a week and measures growth.  
- **Explanatory Variable**: Type of fertilizer (A or B).  
- **Response Variable**: Plant growth.  
- **Statistical Test**: Two-sample **t-test**.  

### **Example 2: Vertical Jump Training**  
A coach assigns basketball players to **three different training programs** and measures their max vertical jump after a week.  
- **Explanatory Variable**: Type of training program (A, B, or C).  
- **Response Variable**: Max vertical jump.  
- **Statistical Test**: **One-way ANOVA**.  

### **Example 3: Real Estate Prices**  
A real estate agent collects data on **house size (square footage)** and **selling price** to analyze their relationship.  
- **Explanatory Variable**: Square footage.  
- **Response Variable**: Selling price.  
- **Statistical Test**: **Simple Linear Regression**.

## **3. Key Takeaways**  
- The **explanatory variable** influences the **response variable**.  
- Used in **experiments and observational studies**.  
- Statistical tests depend on the type of explanatory variable:  
  - **t-test** for two groups.  
  - **ANOVA** for multiple groups.  
  - **Regression** for continuous relationships.  

Understanding these variables is crucial for designing experiments and analyzing data effectively.
