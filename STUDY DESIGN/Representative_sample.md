### **Representative Sample: Definition & Importance**  

#### **What is a Representative Sample?**  
A **representative sample** is a subset of a population that closely reflects the characteristics of the entire population. It ensures that the results of a study can be accurately generalized to the whole group.  

**Example:**  
If a school has **1,000 students** (50% boys and 50% girls), a **representative sample** of 100 students should also have **about 50 boys and 50 girls**. If the sample contains 90 boys and 10 girls, it is **not representative**.

### **Why is a Representative Sample Important?**  
A **representative sample** ensures that findings from a study can be applied to the entire population without bias.  

**Example of Bias:**  
If we survey **only freshmen** in a high school about movie preferences, but the school has equal numbers of freshmen, sophomores, juniors, and seniors, the sample might **not reflect the preferences of the whole school**.

### **How to Obtain a Representative Sample?**  
#### **1. Use an Appropriate Sampling Method**  
The method used to select individuals affects how well the sample represents the population.  

 **Good Sampling Methods:**  
- **Simple Random Sampling:** Every individual has an equal chance of being selected.  
  - Example: Assign a number to each student and randomly select 100 students.  
- **Systematic Random Sampling:** Select every **nth** individual after a random starting point.  
  - Example: Arrange students alphabetically, pick a random starting point, and select every **10th student**.  
- **Stratified Random Sampling:** Divide the population into groups and randomly pick from each group.  
  - Example: Divide students by grade (freshman, sophomore, junior, senior) and randomly pick **25 students from each grade**.  

 **Bad Sampling Methods (May Cause Bias):**  
- **Convenience Sampling:** Choosing individuals who are easiest to reach.  
- **Voluntary Response Sampling:** Only people who feel strongly about a topic respond.

#### **2. Ensure the Sample Size is Large Enough**  
A larger sample size increases the chance of representing the entire population.  

ðŸ”¹ **Factors Affecting Sample Size:**  
- **Population Size:** Larger populations need larger samples.  
- **Confidence Level:** A higher confidence level (e.g., 95% or 99%) requires a larger sample.  
- **Margin of Error:** A lower margin of error (e.g., Â±3% instead of Â±5%) requires a larger sample.  

 **Example:**  
- If we survey **only 8 students**, even if they are from different grades, it might not be enough to represent **1,000 students**.  
- A sample of **100 students** is more likely to capture a variety of preferences.

### **Key Takeaways**  
âœ” A **representative sample** is a small but accurate reflection of the larger population.  
âœ” It ensures **study results can be generalized** without bias.  
âœ” Using **random and systematic sampling methods** improves accuracy.  
âœ” A **larger sample size** reduces errors and increases reliability.
