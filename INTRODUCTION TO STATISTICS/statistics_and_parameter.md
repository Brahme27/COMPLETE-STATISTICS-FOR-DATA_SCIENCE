### **Statistic vs. Parameter: What’s the Difference?**  

In inferential statistics, two key terms help us understand data: **statistic** and **parameter**.  

- **Statistic**: A numerical value that describes a **sample** (a subset of a population).  
- **Parameter**: A numerical value that describes the **entire population**.  

Since measuring an entire population is often impossible, we use **statistics** to estimate **parameters**.

### **Example**  
Suppose we want to determine the average height of palm trees in Florida.  

- **Population**: All palm trees in Florida.  
- **Sample**: A randomly selected group of 100 palm trees.  
- **Statistic**: The average height of these 100 trees (e.g., 36 feet).  
- **Parameter**: The true average height of all palm trees in Florida (unknown).  

Since measuring every single tree is impractical, we rely on a **sample statistic** to estimate the **population parameter**.

### **Common Statistics vs. Parameters**  

| Measurement | Sample Statistic | Population Parameter |
|------------|----------------|-------------------|
| Mean | **x̄** | **μ (mu)** |
| Standard deviation | **s** | **σ (sigma)** |
| Variance | **s²** | **σ² (sigma squared)** |
| Proportion | **p** | **π (pi)** |
| Correlation | **r** | **ρ (rho)** |
| Regression coefficient | **b** | **β (beta)** |

In any study, we aim to determine the **population parameter**, but since it's difficult to measure the entire population, we calculate a **sample statistic** as an estimate.  

For the statistic to be a **good estimate**, the sample must be **representative** of the population.

### **Practice Problems**  

Try identifying the **statistic** and **parameter** in these examples:  

1. **Bird Wingspan**  
   - A researcher measures 50 birds and finds an average wingspan of **15.6 inches**.  
   - **Statistic**: Sample mean **15.6 inches**.  
   - **Parameter**: True average wingspan of all birds in the species.  

2. **Tax Law Approval**  
   - A survey of **1,000 adults** finds that **34%** support a tax law.  
   - **Statistic**: Sample proportion **34%**.  
   - **Parameter**: True proportion of all adults in the city who support the law.  

3. **Income Standard Deviation**  
   - A study of **10,000 people** finds an income standard deviation of **$12,500**.  
   - **Statistic**: Sample standard deviation **$12,500**.  
   - **Parameter**: True standard deviation of incomes in the country.  

4. **Coffee Consumption**  
   - A survey of **200 students** finds an average coffee consumption of **2.2 cups/day**.  
   - **Statistic**: Sample mean **2.2 cups/day**.  
   - **Parameter**: True average coffee consumption for all students at the university.  

By understanding **statistics** and **parameters**, we can make informed decisions about populations based on sample data.
