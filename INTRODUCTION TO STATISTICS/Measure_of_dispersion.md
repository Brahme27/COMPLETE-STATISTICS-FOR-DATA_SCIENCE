## 1. Range

## What it is: 
The difference between the highest and lowest values.

## Real-world scenario:
Imagine you’re tracking the daily temperatures in your city for a week. The highest temperature was 35°C, and the lowest was 20°C.
Range = 35 - 20 = 15°C

## What it tells us: 
It shows the spread of temperatures. A big range means there’s a lot of variation (hot and cold days), while a small range means the weather stayed pretty consistent.

## 2. Interquartile Range (IQR)

## What it is: 
The range of the middle 50% of your data. It ignores extreme high and low values (outliers).

## Real-world scenario:
Imagine you collected the salaries of employees in a company. Most people earn between ₹30,000 and ₹60,000, but there’s a CEO earning ₹5,00,000.
IQR focuses only on the salaries from ₹30,000 to ₹60,000, ignoring the CEO’s salary.

## What it tells us: 
It gives a clear picture of the typical range for most people, without being affected by extreme cases. Great for spotting consistency in data!

## 3. Variance

## What it is: 
It measures how spread out the data is from the average.

## Real-world scenario:
Think of two classrooms. Both have an average score of 75 in a math test:
In Class A, most students scored around 74-76 (very close to the average).
In Class B, some scored 40, others 90, but the average is still 75.

## What it tells us:
Low variance (Class A): Students’ scores are very consistent.
High variance (Class B): Scores are all over the place.
It helps understand how consistent or diverse the data is.

## 4. Standard Deviation (SD)

## What it is: 
It’s like the “practical version” of variance. It tells you, on average, how far each data point is from the mean.

## Real-world scenario:
Let’s go back to the classroom example.
In Class A, if the SD is 2, it means most scores are just 2 marks above or below 75.
In Class B, if the SD is 20, scores are scattered widely from the average.

## What it tells us: 
SD gives an easy-to-understand number to describe the spread. A small SD means data is clustered tightly around the mean. A large SD means it’s spread out.
