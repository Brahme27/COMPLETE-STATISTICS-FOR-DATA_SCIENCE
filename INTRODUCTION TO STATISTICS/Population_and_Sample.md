# Population vs. Sample: What’s the Difference?  

Often in statistics, we’re interested in collecting data to answer a research question.  

For example, we might want to answer the following questions:  

1. What is the median household income in Miami, Florida?  
2. What is the mean weight of a certain population of turtles?  
3. What percentage of residents in a certain county support a certain law?  

In each scenario, we are interested in answering a question about a **population**, which represents every possible individual element we’re interested in measuring.  

However, instead of collecting data on every individual in a population, we collect data on a **sample** of the population, which represents a portion of it.  

- **Population**: Every possible individual element that we are interested in measuring.  
- **Sample**: A portion of the population.  

### Example of Population vs. Sample  

1. **What is the median household income in Miami, Florida?**  
   - The entire population might include **500,000 households**, but we might only collect data on a **sample of 2,000 households**.  

2. **What is the mean weight of a certain population of turtles?**  
   - The entire population might include **800 turtles**, but we might only collect data on a **sample of 30 turtles**.  

3. **What percentage of residents in a certain county support a certain law?**  
   - The entire population might include **50,000 residents**, but we might only collect data on a **sample of 1,000 residents**.  

## Why Use Samples?  

There are several reasons why we collect data on samples instead of entire populations:  

1. **Too time-consuming**: Collecting data on an entire population takes too long. For example, surveying every household in Miami for income data could take years, by which time the population might have changed.  
2. **Too expensive**: It’s often too costly to gather data on an entire population.  
3. **Unfeasible**: In some cases, it’s simply impossible. For instance, tracking and weighing **every turtle** in a wild population could be extremely difficult.  

By collecting data on **samples**, we can gather information about a given population **faster and cheaper**. And if the **sample is representative**, we can generalize the findings to the larger population with confidence.  

## The Importance of Representative Samples  

When collecting a sample from a population, we ideally want the sample to be a **mini version** of the population.  

For example, suppose we want to understand the **movie preferences of students** in a school district with **5,000 total students**. Instead of surveying every student, we might take a **sample of 100 students** and ask them about their preferences.  

- If the **overall population** is **50% girls and 50% boys**, but our sample includes **90% boys and only 10% girls**, it is **not representative**.  
- If the school has **equal numbers of freshmen, sophomores, juniors, and seniors**, but our sample **only includes freshmen**, it is also **not representative**.  

A sample is **representative** if the characteristics of the individuals in the sample **closely match** the characteristics of the overall population. When this happens, we can **generalize** the findings from the sample to the population with confidence.  

## How to Obtain a Representative Sample  

There are many methods to obtain samples from populations. The following three methods **maximize the chances** of obtaining a representative sample:  

### 1. Simple Random Sampling  
Every individual has an **equal chance** of being selected. This can be done using a **random number generator** or any form of random selection.  

**Real-world example:**  
- A university wants to survey **student satisfaction**. They assign a number to each student and randomly select **500 students** to participate.  

### 2. Systematic Random Sampling  
The population is arranged in an order. We **choose a random starting point** and select **every nth member** to be in the sample.  

**Real-world example:**  
- A **supermarket** wants feedback on its customer service. It decides to survey **every 10th customer** who walks in.  

### 3. Stratified Random Sampling  
The population is split into groups, and a **random sample is taken from each group**.  

**Real-world example:**  
- A **company** wants feedback from employees. Instead of randomly selecting employees, they ensure that **every department** (HR, IT, Finance, etc.) is represented proportionally in the sample.  

Using these techniques ensures that the sample **accurately represents** the population, making statistical conclusions **more reliable**.
