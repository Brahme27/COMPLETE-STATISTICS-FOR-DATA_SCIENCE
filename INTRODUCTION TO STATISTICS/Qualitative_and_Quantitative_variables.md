### **Qualitative vs. Quantitative Variables: What’s the Difference?**  

In statistics, all variables fall into two main categories:  

### **1. Quantitative Variables (Numerical)**  
These variables represent measurable quantities.  
**Examples:**  
- Number of students in a class  
- House size (square feet)  
- Population size  
- Age  
- Height  

### **2. Qualitative Variables (Categorical)**  
These variables represent labels or categories.  
**Examples:**  
- Eye color (blue, green, brown)  
- Gender (male, female)  
- Dog breed (lab, bulldog, poodle)  
- Education level (high school, bachelor’s, etc.)  
- Marital status (married, single, divorced)

## **Example Dataset: Basketball Players**
Here’s an example dataset containing information about 10 basketball players:

| Player   | Position | Team | Height (inches) | Weight (lbs) | Seasons Played |
|----------|---------|------|----------------|-------------|---------------|
| Player1  | G       | A    | 74             | 190         | 12            |
| Player2  | F       | B    | 80             | 220         | 10            |
| Player3  | C       | C    | 84             | 250         | 14            |
| Player4  | G       | A    | 75             | 195         | 11            |
| Player5  | F       | B    | 79             | 210         | 13            |
| Player6  | C       | C    | 82             | 240         | 9             |
| Player7  | G       | D    | 76             | 200         | 15            |
| Player8  | F       | A    | 78             | 215         | 10            |
| Player9  | C       | B    | 83             | 245         | 14            |
| Player10 | G       | C    | 73             | 185         | 12            |

## **Classifying Variables**
From the dataset above:  
- **Quantitative Variables (Numerical)**  
  - **Height**, **Weight**, **Seasons Played**  

- **Qualitative Variables (Categorical)**  
  - **Position** (G=Guard, F=Forward, C=Center)  
  - **Team** (A, B, C, D)  

---

## **Summarizing the Variables**
### **1. Summarizing Quantitative Variables (Example: "Seasons Played")**
We can calculate the following metrics:

- **Mean**: 11.5  
- **Median**: 12  
- **Mode**: 12  
- **Range**: 8 (15 - 7)  
- **Interquartile Range (IQR)**: 4.5  
- **Standard Deviation**: 2.915  

These metrics tell us where the central value lies and how spread out the values are.

---

### **2. Summarizing Qualitative Variables (Example: "Position")**
We can use a **frequency table** to count occurrences:

| Position | Frequency |
|----------|----------|
| Guard (G) | 4 |
| Forward (F) | 3 |
| Center (C) | 3 |

This table helps us see how many players belong to each position.

### **Key Takeaways**
- **Quantitative variables** can be analyzed using mean, median, range, and standard deviation.  
- **Qualitative variables** are summarized using frequency tables.  
- Understanding these differences helps in choosing the right statistical methods for analysis.
