### **Levels of Measurement: Nominal, Ordinal, Interval, and Ratio**  

In statistics, data is classified into four **levels of measurement**, each with different properties and analysis methods:  

1. **Nominal (Categorical, No Order)**  
2. **Ordinal (Ordered, No Exact Difference)**  
3. **Interval (Ordered, Exact Difference, No True Zero)**  
4. **Ratio (Ordered, Exact Difference, True Zero)**

### **1. Nominal Scale (Categorical, No Order)**  

- Labels or names categories with **no numerical meaning**.  
- **Example Variables**:  
  - Gender (Male, Female)  
  - Eye Color (Blue, Green, Brown)  
  - Blood Type (A, B, AB, O)  
  - Political Party (Democrat, Republican)  
  - Residence Type (City, Suburb, Rural)  
- **Key Properties**:  
  - No natural order (e.g., Blue is not "higher" than Green).  
  - Categories are **mutually exclusive** (one person can have only one blood type).  
  - **Only counts and mode** (most frequent category) can be calculated.  
- **Example Usage**: Surveys asking for eye color distribution or political preference.

### **2. Ordinal Scale (Ordered, No Exact Difference)**  

- Categories have a **meaningful order**, but **differences between them are not measurable**.  
- **Example Variables**:  
  - Satisfaction Level (Very Unsatisfied → Unsatisfied → Neutral → Satisfied → Very Satisfied)  
  - Education Level (High School → Bachelor’s → Master’s → Ph.D.)  
  - Socioeconomic Status (Low → Medium → High)  
- **Key Properties**:  
  - Natural **ranking exists** (e.g., Very Satisfied > Satisfied).  
  - **Differences are not uniform** (difference between Satisfied & Neutral ≠ Neutral & Unsatisfied).  
  - **Mode & Median** can be calculated, but **mean cannot**.  
- **Example Usage**: Customer satisfaction surveys, job levels in a company.

### **3. Interval Scale (Ordered, Exact Difference, No True Zero)**  

- Ordered categories with **exact differences**, but **no absolute zero**.  
- **Example Variables**:  
  - Temperature (°C, °F) → 0°C doesn’t mean "no temperature."  
  - SAT Scores (400 to 1600)  
  - Credit Scores (300 to 850)  
- **Key Properties**:  
  - Exact **differences between values** (e.g., 30°F to 40°F is the same as 70°F to 80°F).  
  - **Mean, Median, Mode, and Standard Deviation** can be calculated.  
  - No true zero → **ratios cannot be computed** (e.g., 80°F is not "twice as hot" as 40°F).  
- **Example Usage**: SAT score distribution, credit score analysis.  

---

### **4. Ratio Scale (Ordered, Exact Difference, True Zero)**  

- Ordered, exact differences, and **a true zero** (where zero means absence of the variable).  
- **Example Variables**:  
  - Height (cm, inches, feet)  
  - Weight (kg, lbs)  
  - Age (years)  
  - Income ($0 means no income)  
- **Key Properties**:  
  - **All statistical calculations** (mean, median, mode, standard deviation) are possible.  
  - Has a **true zero**, allowing **ratios** (e.g., 200 lbs is twice as heavy as 100 lbs).  
  - **Cannot have negative values** (no negative height or weight).  
- **Example Usage**: Growth measurement, weight tracking, financial analysis.

### **Summary Table**  

| **Property**                 | **Nominal** | **Ordinal** | **Interval** | **Ratio** |
|-----------------------------|------------|------------|------------|------------|
| Has a natural order?        | ❌ No       | ✅ Yes      | ✅ Yes      | ✅ Yes      |
| Mode can be calculated?     | ✅ Yes      | ✅ Yes      | ✅ Yes      | ✅ Yes      |
| Median can be calculated?   | ❌ No       | ✅ Yes      | ✅ Yes      | ✅ Yes      |
| Mean can be calculated?     | ❌ No       | ❌ No       | ✅ Yes      | ✅ Yes      |
| Exact difference between values? | ❌ No   | ❌ No       | ✅ Yes      | ✅ Yes      |
| Has a **true zero**?        | ❌ No       | ❌ No       | ❌ No       | ✅ Yes      |

### **Key Takeaways**

- **Nominal**: Categories with no order (e.g., eye color).  
- **Ordinal**: Ordered categories, but differences aren't exact (e.g., satisfaction level).  
- **Interval**: Ordered, exact differences, but no true zero (e.g., temperature in °C).  
- **Ratio**: Ordered, exact differences, and true zero (e.g., weight, height).  

This classification helps in selecting the right **statistical methods** for data analysis.
